# KK-Plugins-Compendium
 Hello good people. I have made this repository for the sole purpose to assist the koikatsu modding community in compiling/documenting plugins all in one place this is an archive made to gather tutorials,general knowledge,links and info about most of Koikatsu related Plugins made for the game by the modding community. 

 - In this archive you will be able to find most plugins that are compiled into the HF-Patch/Better Repack and other various plugins made by the modding community which would be a nice addition to ones game.
  
 - To get info about individual plugins, you as the user need to head over to [Plugins Compendium] and browser through the massive list of plugins currently available, most plugins listed there have the name of their Author(s) along with a link to acquiring the plugin/more information. 

 - Note while some of these plugins have an alternative version made for other illusion games most of these plugins were made/converted for Koikatsu Only.

- This archive is currently a WIP and future changes will happen to it, so please be patient with us and thank you for your time.
