# KK-Plugins-Compendium
 An archive made to gather toturials/general knowledge and info about current Koikatsu related Plugins made for the game.
 
 In this archive you will be able to find most plugins that are used by the HF-Patch which were made by the modding community for Koikatsu.
  
  To get info about individual plugins you as the user need to head over to [Later name] look at the massive list of plugins currently available, most plugins listed there have the name of their Author along with a link to acquiring the plugin and another link poiting towards a guide on what said plugin does/how to use it.
 
This archive is currently a WIP so please be patient with us and thank you for your time.
