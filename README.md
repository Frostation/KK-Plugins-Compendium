# KK-Plugins-Compendium

 Hello good people. I have made this repository for the sole purpose of assisting the koikatsu modding community and Koikatsu users to find plugins a bit easier by compiling/documenting most if not all plugins in one place. This is an archive made to gather tutorials,general knowledge,links and info about most of Koikatsu related Plugins made for the game by the modding community. 


 ### Things to take a note of
 
 - In this archive you will be able to find most plugins that are compiled into the HF-Patch/Better Repack and other various plugins made by the modding community which would be a nice addition to ones game.

 - For information regarding what plugins are included in each iteration of the HF patch please take a look at this page [HF-Patch Plugins List](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KK-HF_Patch/blob/master/Plugin%20Readme.md).
  
 - To get info about individual plugins for Koikatsu, you as the user need to head over to [Plugins Compendium](https://github.com/Frostation/KK-Plugins-Compendium/blob/master/Plugins%20Compendium.md) or to view Plugins for Koikatsu Sunshine head over to [Plugins Compendium Sunshine](https://github.com/Frostation/KK-Plugins-Compendium/blob/master/Plugins%20Comendium%20Sunshine.md) and browse through the massive list of plugins currently available, most plugins listed there have the name of their Author(s) along with a link to acquiring the plugin/more information. 

 - Please note that with the addition of the latest Koikatsu game, Koikatsu Sunshine there will now be an additional compendium for designated plugins for that game, most plugins will have an "KKS" in their name when you update them from various sites so please make sure to note these some plugins may function both ways (The reason for this is the usage of proper filtering from programmers so that they would work on both games) but do note that some plugins may lose compatibiilty in the future and be completely seperate so make sure to check the notes for each plugin in their designated location.
 
 - Please read the instructions and Requirements of plugins thoroughly within their pages/manuals/readmes if they have any otherwise it may cause problems for your game.

 - You may notice that some of the files listed aren't exactly plugins but since they work in tandem with some of the plugins made by the community hence they will be added.
 
 - Please do note that while many to most of these plugins work in tandem, a small number of them do not and some are older versions of said plugins that have been listed here to be documented and found if a user is looking for the older version.

 - Some plugins fall under a one file catagory meaning that getting a singular file such as IllusionFixes for example gives one a multitude of plugins that have been listed in the compendium, hence multiple downloads of the same file are unecessary. 

 - Note while some of these plugins have an alternative version made for other illusion games, most of these plugins were made/converted for Koikatsu Only.

 - There is a new category added which will be tidied up in future versions which will move all obsolete/old/IPA plugins and the like there which are not reccomended for installation at all. [Old Plugins](https://github.com/Frostation/KK-Plugins-Compendium/blob/master/Plugins%20Compendium.md#list-of-plugins-either-too-oldincompatibleoutsourcedobsoleted-these-plugins-are-not-reccomended-for-installation-and-have-been-put-here-for-archiving-which-include)

- This archive is currently a WIP and future changes will happen to it, so please be patient with us and thank you for your time.
